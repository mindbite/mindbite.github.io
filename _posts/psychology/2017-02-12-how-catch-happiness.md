<p>Think for a time when you’ve reached your one ultimate goal that you told yourself would make you so happy and contented for the rest of your life. That dream job you’ve always wanted since you were in kindergarten. That sports car that had pushed you to be as frugal as you can be for five years. That gorgeous girl that’s filled your nightly and daily fantasies.</p>

**And then what?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As days past your delight wanes* into mere satisfaction, and then to pure recognition of your win, until you don’t realize that it had already slides into obscurity of the mundanity of your day-to-day life, and you “realizing” that this another new dream is “what would make you  and contented for the rest of your life”.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called habituation that phenomenon when you become so accommodated* to a certain thing that it barely gives you any heightened feeling—good or bad. :a: We tend to overestimate the amount of change one thing would bring to our lives disregarding the fact of habituation after a while.:a:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can’t we find that one true happiness, and is there some merit to always wanting for more?

<h3>The two faces of happiness</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main different types of happiness, reflective happiness and experiential happiness. The former is that smile you get or that pride you feel whenver you reflect about how smart you are, or how far you have reached in the corporate ladder, the latter is the delight you feel whenever you try do something interesting in on a given day, that nice conversation you had with your friend, that delicious ice cream you tasted fom that newly opened gelatto* place*.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be have both happiness, if you do, well congratulations to you, but for a lot of us, you may be rant about how you don’t like what is going on with your life, how you don’t like what you do in your office or in school, how much you just want to have another place to leave, but when asked to assess your life, you may answer a completely ironic answer that life is good, and you are contented with your life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, I tend to err on the opposite side, I love that I could make friends now unlike before when my social anxiety is at it’s height that everyone seems like a threat, I love that whenever I laugh now it’s real and not nervous laughter, I even deliberately make jokes that I now are silly and would make me corny and look dumb, so based on experiential happiness, I am happier that I was before. It’s when I reflect on my life that things gets hay wired*, because everytime that I would look back all I seem to see is how much I missed out on life, how shitty it is that I am a second-year college student when my classmates are already registered engineers and certified public accountants, how disheartening it is that I am at the bottom of my classes now when only five years ago I was considered one of the smartest. So when it comes to reflective happiness, I am the saddest.

Why do we have this two different ways of evaluating how happy or sad we are at the moment? Is one truer than the other?

You may be expecting for me to say that experiential happiness or the delight we get from savouring life’s little pleasures is the ultimate and true happiness, but with all the other things that I have read, that would definitely be a hasty conclusion. We want to honor the little joys that we have, but not at the expense of ignoring the opportunity to see things at another perspective.

If we say that true happiness only comes from the little joys of life, then that is basically saying that the feeling of enlighnement you gain from reflecting on you high academic achievement, or how good looking you are, or how lucky you are in life is basically a fake illusion.

Looking for the dark clouds in the horizon during a sun-shiny day

If I ask you what is the latest news, what comes first into your mind? [some latest good news here]? Or the terrorist bomb threat on a nearby city? If you answer something like the latter, then you just might have triggered your negativity bias. In fact I am guilty myself, that I had to search on the internet to find some good news as I can’t think of any at the time of writing this.

The negativity bias is your tendency to focus on the negative things in life even when there is so much positive things your could lean towards.

Whenever life feels gloomy and your friend advices you to look on the positive side of things and you tell him to shut the fuck up as there is not a single good thing in the world for you at the moment, boy that exactly what the negativity bias is.

You and I both want to be happy with our lives, but it just seems that a great part of our brain is designed to especially look for things correct, to improve, to change, to get alarmed with, and maybe for a legitimate reason

<h2 class="section-heading">Your Brain in the African Savanna, Featuring The Saber-Toothed Tiger</h2>

You may have already read or heard hundreds of times about how our brains are still designed for the savannas as if we are hunter-gatherer’s 10,000 years ago with the saber-toothed tiger just lurking in the darks, so you may already know where this is heading to, there is some evolutionary reasons on why we tend to focus on the negative.

For one, always having a radar on against possible threats make us mentally and physically equipped the next time saby just tries suddenly lurch into us from behind the bushes to turn us into his lunch. It makes us adept at detecting threats more easily be that life-threatening or just feels like it.

The agitation that we get makes us less likely to settle for too long on a particular place or situation, during those times way way back, when contentment and slacking off could mean snatched up* wife, or worst death by starvation.

You of course probably is shouting that it is the 2017, the saber-toothed tiger don’t even exist anymore and the McDonald and it’s happy meal is just one click of a button away, and that you’ll probably get divorced faster than some other caveman stealing your wife.

Your brain, the human brain, is one of the most powerful organs or devices that we know of, but of course it has it’s quirks that we probably would need another 10,000 years to correct on itself, the challenge for now is how can we compensate and choose to be happy when all we see are the dark clouds even far from the horizon.

<h2 class="section-heading">The natural baseline of happiness</h2>

The baseline of happiness is your average feeling on the happiness-sadness spectrum, your neutral level, some other people may be predisposed to a happier baseline, while other’s may lean toward the other side, but still remains that the heightened feeling that you feel, though might seem like forever will always fall back or rise to your baseline.

This has some both good and bad implications, on the bright side, even if it feels like that you are doosmed for shit for the rest of your life, that gloomy feeling would subside until you’re back to your baseline. Now that is regardless whether the situation actually got better.

On the less nice side, it means that even though you think that you would be the world’s happiest person if only you reach goal A, that exhilaration is just temporary and would quickly slide into habituation until you decide that getting goal b would make you happy for the rest of your life. We tend to overestimate the amount of change one thing would bring to our lives disregarding the fact of habituation after having gotten in for a while.

The effect of habituation is not created equal, the elation from material things like getting a new smartphone tends to subside pretty quickly as compared with the joy from experiential things like having a nice chat with a friend or trying a new  creative hobby.

So, though cliché as it might sound, as much as you can, go with "buying" experiences.

<h2 class="section-heading">When you can’t force a smile, bite a pencil</h2>

There are tons of techniques to make yourself happier or experience more of it, some even proven by science.

Of course I couldn’t just list them all here, it would just makes more likely that you won’t do any, so I’ll just ask you to do one single technique that is not just proven by science but would also require you the slightest effort, you actually don’t even have to tell yourself to be happier.

Get a pencil and put it between your teeth for at least 30 seconds, horizontally of course.

What it does is it moves the muscles in your face in a way as if you are smiling, which has in turn has the interesting reverse effect of inducing an actual smile, aside from it looking funny and absurd in the first place.

When I do it I’ll tend to extend it to a full minute.

You doesn’t have to tell yourself to be happier which may have already failed at the moment, you just have to let the pencil do the work.

It may not solve your problem, it may not take away your chronic stress, but it’s a good first aid, when you’re more ready to deliberately be happier, move to that, but for now, all you need is a pencil in between you
